# Description
You can commit crimes in various dimensions which will increase your crime mater and with it, it will cause the [[Police]] to be more hostile with you.   
# Purpose
The crime system meant to prevent the player from exploitation of the resources of each level.
# Technical notes
We basically need a way to represent this crime mater on the ui and we need a class which will grab all crime signal. We also need to determine how will the Police guys react.
